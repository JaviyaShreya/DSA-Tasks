1. https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

A detailed explanation of solution

The solution works by checking every pair of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target. 
The first loop picks one number, and the second loop goes through the numbers after it to find a match. 
If two numbers add up to the target, their positions in the array (indices) are returned. This method is simple and makes sure all pairs are checked until the right one is found.

2.  https://leetcode.com/problems/find-n-unique-integers-sum-up-to-zero/
   
A detailed explanation of solution

The code creates an array of size n where the numbers add up to zero. I
f n is odd, it places a 0 at the last position. Then, it uses a loop to fill the array with pairs of positive and negative numbers. 
For example, it puts -1 at index 0 and 1 at index 1, -2 at index 2 and 2 at index 3, and so on, until the array is filled. 
This ensures that the sum of all the numbers in the array is zero. The code handles both odd and even values of n and prints the result after filling the array.

3. https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/

A detailed explanation of solution

This code finds the subarray with the highest sum in an array of numbers. 
It starts by setting the maxSum to the smallest possible value and currentSum to 0. 
Then, it goes through each number in the array, adding it to currentSum. 
After each addition, it checks if currentSum is larger than maxSum and updates maxSum if needed. 
If currentSum becomes negative, it resets it to 0 because continuing with a negative sum won't help in finding a larger sum. 
At the end, maxSum will hold the largest sum of any consecutive numbers in the array, and thatâ€™s returned as the result. 
This method is simple and fast because it only goes through the array once.

5. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/second-largest3735/1

A detailed explanation of solution

The program first checks if the array has fewer than two elements, returning -1 if true. 
It then initializes largest with the first element and secondLargest as -1. 
As it loops through the array, it updates largest and secondLargest based on the values it encounters. 
If an element is larger than largest, it updates secondLargest and sets largest to the current element. 
If an element is between largest and secondLargest, it updates secondLargest. Finally, it returns secondLargest, or -1 if no second largest value exists.

6. https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/description/

A detailed explanation of solution

The code calculates the length of the longest valid parentheses substring using two passes over the string, one from left to right and the other from right to left. 
In each pass, two counters (left and right) are used to track the number of opening and closing parentheses. 
If the counts of left and right match, the length of the valid substring is updated. 
If right exceeds left in the left-to-right pass or left exceeds right in the right-to-left pass, the counters are reset. 
This ensures that only balanced parentheses contribute to the result.

8. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
   
A detailed explanation of solution

Our code implements a binary search algorithm to find a target element in a rotated sorted array. 
The array is divided into two parts using a mid-point. Depending on whether the left or right half is sorted, the algorithm checks if the target lies within the sorted portion. 
If it does, the search continues in that portion; otherwise, it proceeds to the other half. 
The loop runs until the target is found or the search range becomes invalid (start > end), in which case -1 is returned.

9. https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/
    
A detailed explanation of solution

This code uses binary search to find the correct index for inserting the target value into a sorted array. 
It starts with two pointers, start and end, to represent the search range. The middle element is compared with the target. 
If they match, it returns the index. If the target is smaller, the search range is narrowed to the left side; if larger, it narrows to the right. 
This continues until the correct index is found, or the target should be inserted. 
The time complexity is O(log n) because the search range halves each time, and the space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used.

10. https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/
    
A detailed explanation of solution

This code merges two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, into nums1. 
It starts by comparing the largest unmerged elements from both arrays, placing the larger element at the end of nums1. 
It uses three pointers: i for nums1, j for nums2, and k for the last position of nums1. This continues until all elements from nums2 are placed in nums1. 
The time complexity is O(m + n), where m and n are the sizes of the arrays, and the space complexity is O(1) since the merge happens in-place.
